# Project state

Resume point for a fresh session. Updated at milestones; see `docs/ROADMAP.md`
for the long-form plan and `docs/GEOMETRY_SOURCES.md` for licensing.

## What this is

A 3D atlas of the human musculoskeletal, neural and vascular systems, built to
plan musculoskeletal injections — PRP, and botulinum toxin for spasticity — as
well as to serve as a general atlas, an ultrasound and cross-section reference,
and a comparison against CT and MRI. Target resolution is sub-1 mm³/voxel.
The repository is proprietary and sellable; no CC BY-SA source may enter it.

Branch: `claude/3d-human-anatomy-atlas-e0kbxe`. 149 tests pass (includes bone-only frame derivation for CT).

No CT data is available yet from the repository owner (they have clinical
scans but haven't set up Python 3.13/TotalSegmentator on Windows). Pending
that, work has continued on literature-based content depth — see below.

## Recently deepened (literature-based, no geometry needed)

- **Lymphatic system**: 23 → 56 entities. Added the head/neck superficial
  node groups (submental, submandibular, parotid, mastoid, occipital,
  superficial cervical), supraclavicular nodes, mediastinal nodes
  (tracheobronchial, paratracheal, parasternal), abdominal nodes (celiac,
  superior/inferior mesenteric, lumbar/para-aortic), and the full pelvic
  chain (common/external/internal iliac, obturator). Reparented deep
  inguinal nodes onto the new external iliac nodes (was wired straight to
  the lumbar trunk).
- **Fascia**: added the osteofascial compartments of the hand (carpal
  tunnel, thenar, hypothenar, adductor, interosseous) and foot (medial,
  lateral, central, interosseous) — the surgical fasciotomy models,
  parallel to the leg/forearm compartments already carried.
- **Autonomic nervous system**: new, was entirely absent. Added the
  sympathetic trunk end to end — cervical chain (superior/middle cervical
  ganglia, stellate ganglion), thoracic chain with the splanchnic nerves,
  lumbar and sacral chains, ganglion impar, and the celiac and hypogastric
  plexuses. These are exactly the targets of stellate ganglion, lumbar
  sympathetic, celiac plexus and hypogastric plexus blocks — real
  image-guided procedures this atlas's injection-planning purpose covers.

## Atlas frame

+X subject's right, +Y superior, +Z anterior, millimetres, origin at the
midpoint of the two hip joint centres.

- DU Visible Human STL → atlas: `--axes='-x,-z,+y' --units mm --origin '346.821,173.476,426.352'`
- NIfTI RAS → atlas: `(x, z, y)`; a positive-determinant affine means the scan
  is stored mirrored and is refused, never silently corrected.

## Data model decisions that are easy to get wrong

- **Nerve ids are side-agnostic** (`axillary_n`), **vessel ids are sided**
  (`_r`/`_l`). A nerve's targets must therefore name both sides.
- `innervation.nerve` is a string, or a **list** where a muscle has more than
  one nerve. Packed pseudo-ids (`femoral_n_and_obturator_n`) are rejected.
- Every compartment carries `innervation_branch_ids`, and every nerve so named
  lists the compartment back in `targets`. A test holds both directions.
- **The compartment, not the muscle, is the unit a nerve block or a botulinum
  plan works in.**
- Endplate zones are stored **in the source's own terms** — a percent range
  along a named line between two landmarks — and are deliberately NOT converted
  into `position_fraction_along_fascicle`, because published reference lines run
  in varying directions and several run distal-to-proximal.
- The sciatic division is modelled from the popliteal fossa down; hamstring
  branches hang off the undivided trunk. Deliberate, documented in the tree.

## Geometry status

| Region | Source | State |
|---|---|---|
| Pelvis → ankle | DU Visible Human (CC BY 4.0) | ingested, `build/vh/vhm_both` |
| Above the hip | none yet | **blocked** — see below |

122 landmarks are measured against geometry: median 1.2 mm from the bone
surface, all within 15 mm. 217 anchors, median 0.9 mm from their own bone.

## Blocked on the repository owner

Python 3.13 is needed on the Windows machine — the installed 3.14 free-threaded
build has no pip, so `nibabel` and `scikit-image` cannot be installed:

```
py -3.13 -m pip install nibabel scikit-image
```

Then, for a TotalSegmentator subject that includes the pelvis:

```
python3 scripts/merge_totalsegmentator_masks.py <subject_dir> -o merged.nii.gz
python3 scripts/ingest_volume_geometry.py inspect merged.nii.gz
python3 scripts/ingest_volume_geometry.py propose merged.nii.gz --subject ct01
python3 scripts/ingest_volume_geometry.py convert merged.nii.gz --subject ct01 --origin '<from inspect>'
python3 scripts/audit_landmarks_vs_geometry.py --subject ct01
```

The 0.33 mm `Original 3D STL Models-stl` ingest (`--subject vhm_raw`) is also
waiting. TotalSegmentator's dataset licence (CC BY 4.0) was verified at Zenodo
by the owner, because Zenodo is unreachable from the build machine.

## Open, in rough priority order

1. **`phalanges_hand` is 14 bones as one entity.** Seven muscles per side
   resolve to digit III. Needs the grouped entity split — a data-model change,
   and there is no hand geometry to measure against yet.
2. **Common flexor and extensor origins** on the humerus carry five muscles
   each on one coordinate. Splitting them means authoring, not measuring, until
   there is upper-limb geometry.
3. **Flexor hallucis brevis** is refused an anchor: its two heads insert on
   opposite sides of the hallux and the generator emits one anchor per muscle
   end, not per compartment. The refusal is correct; per-compartment anchors
   would fix it.
4. **Tibialis anterior and fibularis longus** insertion paths are still blocked
   by bone; closing them needs via points that cannot be measured from the
   geometry available.
5. Spine, rib and sternum landmarks have no numeric coordinates — to be measured
   from CT once (1) above is unblocked.
6. Extend `named_members` in the landmark audit to ribs and vertebrae, so the
   identity check covers them.
7. ~~Cross-check generated moment arms against OpenSim's published models.~~
   **Done** — `scripts/validate_moment_arms.py`, 10/12 computable pairs land
   inside their published range. See ROADMAP.md Stage 6.
8. ~~Semitendinosus, semimembranosus and the left gluteus maximus are
   missing their insertion anchor.~~ **Fixed** — three landmark-matching
   gaps in `data/skeleton/bones.json` (217 → 226 anchors). See ROADMAP.md
   Stage 6 for detail.
9. Semitendinosus's knee-flexion moment arm computes 3–5 mm against a
   published 15–35 mm — not a data error, the straight-line moment-arm
   method's own documented limit meeting a muscle whose real path wraps
   the medial tibial condyle. Fixing it needs a wrap surface or via point,
   which the anchor/rig schema doesn't carry yet.

## Next action

Whatever is unblocked from the list above; otherwise wait on the CT ingest.
